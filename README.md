# 📊 Python Data Visualization Project (Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly)

This project demonstrates complete data visualization techniques using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** libraries in Python.  
The goal is to understand different ways of exploring and presenting data — from static to fully interactive visualizations.

---

## 🧩 **Project Overview**

The dataset used in this project is based on diamond pricing and characteristics such as **carat**, **cut**, **color**, and **clarity**.  
Each visualization library shows a different level of flexibility and interactivity.

---

## 🪶 **1. Matplotlib & Seaborn Visualizations**

### ✅ Covered Visualizations
- Line plots, bar plots, and histograms  
- Scatter plots and boxplots  
- Violin plots and pair plots  
- Heatmaps and facet grids  
- Subplots and advanced layout customization  

### 📈 Example Insights
- Strong positive relationship between **carat** and **price**  
- Clear variation in **price** distribution across different **cut** types  
- Heatmap revealed correlations among carat, price, and other numeric features  

---

## ⚡ **2. Plotly Visualizations (Interactive)**

After static visualization, the project explores **interactive charts** using Plotly and Plotly Express.  
These graphs allow hover effects, zoom, tooltips, and real-time interactions.

### 🎨 Covered Graph Types
- Scatter, line, and bar charts  
- Box and violin plots  
- Density contour and heatmaps  
- 3D scatter plots and bubble charts  
- Subplots and area charts  
- Pie chart and cumulative area chart  

### 💡 Example Insight
Interactive plots made it easier to identify how **cut** and **clarity** influence diamond pricing in a dynamic way.

## 📌 **Key Learnings**
- Learned to visualize relationships and distributions effectively  
- Understood how to move from static (Matplotlib/Seaborn) to dynamic (Plotly) visualizations  
- Improved understanding of customization, styling, and subplot management  
- Learned to use aggregation (`agg(['mean', 'std'])`) for grouped bar plots with error bars  

---

## 🧩 **Next Step**
The next step will involve connecting visualization results with **machine learning predictions**, like price forecasting and regression visualization.

## 🖼️ **Sample Graphs**
> Includes plots like:
> - Carat vs Price (Scatter)
> - Price Distribution (Histogram)
> - Average Price by Cut (Bar with Error)
> - 3D Scatter Plot
> - Heatmap of Correlation
